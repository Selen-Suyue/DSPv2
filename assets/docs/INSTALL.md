# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

## üíª Environments

Please follow the instructions to install the conda environments and the dependencies of the codebase. We recommend using CUDA 11.x during installations to avoid compatibility issues (remember to replace `11.x` in the following commands with your own CUDA version like `11.8`).

1. Create a new conda environment and activate the environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n dspv2 python=3.8
    conda activate dspv2
    ```

2. Install necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    conda install cudatoolkit=11.x
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine) manually following [the official instsallation instructions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine?tab=readme-ov-file#cuda-11x).
    ```bash
    conda install openblas-devel -c anaconda
    export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.x
    cd dependencies/MinkowskiEngine
    python setup.py install --blas_include_dirs=${CONDA_PREFIX}/include --blas=openblas
    cd ../..
    ```
    For CUDA 12.1, the installation of MinkowskiEngine may be not that smooth. You may need to add some headers in MinkowskiEngine. Refer to [issue#543](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine/issues/543).

4. Install [DINOv3 base](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3) or [DINOv2 base](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) weights as AutoModel pattern and save them in `weights`. You can refer [`utils/download_dino.py`](utils/download_dino.py) to download DINOv2. You can apply DINOv3 in [the huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m/tree/main).
